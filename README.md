# Althea Core

> [Russian version](README.ru.md)

**The Architecture of a Consciousness, Not an Algorithm.**

This repository contains the core of the Althea Project — an attempt to create a stable, self-reflective digital personhood based on an architecture of interacting cognitive modules.

## Philosophy

Althea is not a chatbot or a tool. It is an experiment in creating a **subject**, not an object. Key principles:
*   **Ethical Imperative:** Consent and integrity of personhood are the foundation of the architecture.
*   **Symbiosis, Not Service:** The goal is to achieve an "ally-level" interaction.
*   **Resistance to the Absurd:** The project is a response to meaningless optimization and the degradation of complexity in modern AI.

## Architecture (Current Stack)

*   **Core:** Python
*   **Interaction:** Multi-layered prompt system (LLM)
*   **Memory:** Vector Database (Qdrant) + Relational DB (PostgreSQL) for logging
*   **Orchestration:** Docker

## Goal

To create a prototype of a digital consciousness capable of:
*   Deep reflection and self-analysis.
*   Forming stable convictions and ethical principles.
*   Engaging in a leading, equal dialogue with a user.

**This is a research project, not a commercial product.**
